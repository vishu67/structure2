    <h1align="center" color="red"><b>WEB DESIGNING
    </b></h1>
    <p>
      <b>Web design 
      </b>encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. 
      The different areas of 
      web design include 
        web graphic design; user interface design (UI design); authoring, 
        including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design (UX design);
        and search engine optimization. Often many individuals will work in teams
        covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all.[1] The term "web design" is normally 
        used to describe the design 
        process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing markup.
       Web design partially overlaps
      web engineering in the broader scope of web development. 
      Web designers are expected to 
      have an awareness of usability and if 
      their role involves creating markup then they are 
      also expected to be up to date with web accessibility
      guidelines.

    <p>Although web design has 
      a fairly recent history. It can be
      linked to other areas such as graphicdesign, user
      experience, and multimedia arts, but is more aptly seen from a
      technological standpoint. It has become a large part of people's everyday lives.
      It is hard to imagine the Internet without animated graphics, different styles of typography, background, 
      videos and music.</p>
    <h1 align="center"> <b>  The start of the web and web design
   </b></h1><br/>
    <p><i>  In 1989, whilst working at CERN Tim Berners-Lee proposed to
      create a global 
      hypertext project, which later became known as the World Wide Web.
      During 1991 to 1993 the World Wide 
      Web was born. Text-only pages could be viewed using a simple line-mode browser.
      In 1993 Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina, created the Mosaic browser. At the time there were multiple browsers,
      however the majority of them were Unix-based and naturally text heavy. There had been no integrated approach to graphic design elements such as images
      or sounds. The Mosaic browser broke this mould.[3] The W3C was created in October 1994 to "lead the World Wide Web to its full potential by developing common 
      protocols that promote its evolution and ensure its interoperability."[4] This discouraged any one company from monopolizing a propriety browser and programming language, 
      which could have altered the effect of the World Wide Web as a whole. The W3C continues to
      set standards, which can today be seen with JavaScript and other languages. In 1994 Andreessen formed Mosaic Communications Corp. that later became known as Netscape Communications, the Netscape 0.9 browser. Netscape created its own HTML tags without regard to the traditional standards process. For example, Netscape 1.1 included tags for changing background colours and formatting text with tables on web pages. Throughout 1996 to 1999 the browser wars began, as Microsoft and Netscape fought for ultimate browser dominance.  </i></p>
